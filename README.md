# RHCF
A new visual tracker called RHCF based on correlation filter.

NOTE: This tracker is an improved approach based on CF2 (HCF), so there are plenty of codes are brought from CF2, and the paper name is "Hierarchical Convolutional Features for Visual Tracking".

1. Download the VGG-NET-19 mat file and put into the model folder using the link
https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/kxzjhbagd6ih1rf7mjyoxn2hy70hltpl.mat

or using the link if you are in China
http://pan.baidu.com/s/1kU1Me5T 

Note that this mat file is compatile with the MatConvNet-1beta10 used in this work, if you download the mat file from
http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat,
please pay attention to the version compatibility.  

2. Include the path of matconvnet/matlab

3. Run the main entry file run_tracker.m

% Note that run_RHCF is an interfance for OBT-50 and OBT-100:
%
% process a sequence using RHCF (Correlation filter tracking with convolutional features)
%
% Input:
%     - seq:        sequence name
%     - res_path:   result path
%     - bSaveImage: flag for saving images
% Output:
%     - results: tracking results, position prediction over time

The folder RHCF_OTB2013_Mat_results includes the results of RHCF over OTB2013.

Follow-up will gradually finish the source code of the tracker, please wait a moment
